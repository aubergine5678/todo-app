# todo-app
A simple little work-in-progress todo app I wrote in about 2 hours to learn Rust.
It's not actually a _good_ to-do app, please don't use it as such.

If you decide you want to have a looksy, just do like a `git clone` and then `cargo run`? I think that should work... but again, I'm very new to rust so `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
